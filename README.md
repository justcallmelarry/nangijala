# Nangijala

Nangijala is a webservice handling what is commonly known as a "Dead Man's Switch" (morbid, I know, but seems useful!).\
A dead man's switch is basically a button (or switch) needed to be refreshed every once in a while, or something will happen.

In the movies it's usually the bad guy releasing some sort of world devestating event if he (or she, but going with the statistics here) dies, but for my own part its mostly sendin SMS's, emails, and files to people I know, ensuring that someone takes care of my cats in case I vanish off the face of the earth (or at least, the internet). At least until I can figure out what my own world devestating event will be.
